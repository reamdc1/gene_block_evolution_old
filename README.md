gene_block_evolution
====================

This project holds all the code needed to analyze gene blocks for my thesis. This project replaces any related repositories on my account.


I will be adding to this page and the project in the next few days to complete the pipeline.  

TODO: 
1) Add a master script that will handle running the pipeline in a single set of commands.  
It will eventually add functionality to run from various checkpiints i.e. DB setup, BLAST query creation, 
BLAST, BLAST parsing and filtering, and analysis. Later i hope to add code for visualization from the lab's programmer.
